Feature: Calculate electricity bill

  
  Scenario Outline: Calculate Energy Charges Units consumed upto 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    And my slab is <slab>
    When I check for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | slab | Energy charge |
      |   40 | 4.05 |           162 |
      |   50 | 4.05 |         202.5 |
