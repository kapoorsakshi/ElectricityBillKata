Feature: Calculate electricity bill

  
  Scenario Outline: Calculate Energy Charges Units consumed upto 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    And my slab is <slab>
    When I calcuate for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | slab | energy charge |
      |   40 | 4.05 |           162.00 |
      |   50 | 4.05 |         202.50 |
      
      
      
      Scenario Outline: Calculate FCA Charges Units consumed upto 50 units
        When FCA charge is FCA_slab <fca_slab>
    Then I verify the FCA charge <FCA charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | FCA charge | fca_slab
      |   40 |        5.20 | 0.13
      |   50 |        6.50 |0.13
