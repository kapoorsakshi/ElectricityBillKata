Feature: Calculate electricity bill

  Scenario Outline: Calculate Energy Charges Units consumed upto 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    And my slab is <slab>
    When I calcuate for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | slab | energy charge |
      |   40 | 4.05 |        162.00 |
      |   50 | 4.05 |        202.50 |

  Scenario Outline: Calculate FCA Charges Units consumed upto 50 units
    When FCA_slab is <fca_slab>
    Then I verify the FCA charge <FCA charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | fca_slab | FCA charge |
      |   40 |     0.13 |       5.20 |
      |   50 |     0.13 |       6.50 |

  Scenario Outline: Calculate Total Duty Charge Units consumed upto 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    And my duty charge slab is <duty slab>
    And I get slab wise duty charges < G >
    And I get FCA on Duty < H >
    When I Total FCA Charges <Total Duty charges I >
    Then I verify slab wise duty charges

  Examples: 
      | unit | duty slab | Slab wise duty charges G |FCA Duty charges H | Total Duty charges I |
      |   40 |      0.09 |                     3.60 |               0.468 |                    4.068 |
      |   50 |      0.09 |                     4.50 |               0.585 |                    5.085 |
